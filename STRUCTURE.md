# Structure

An agentic project (e.g. `agentic-acme`) is the externalized *thought* about the
work; the software under development is the *action*, hosted beneath it. Its
rooms map to the five W's.

| W | room | holds |
|---|---|---|
| Who | `cast/` | personas (Powell, Keenan & McDaid 2007), examples Mara + Wren |
| What | `<software>/` (with the code) | behavioural (`.allium`) + temporal (`.tla`) specs, verified in the software's CI; the host `plan/` references them |
| When | `plan/` | the milestone index and folders |
| Where | `<software>/` | the hosted software, a bare store with worktrees; you add it |
| Why | `call/` | decisions about the software (MADR; see `call/0000`); methodology lives in the spine, not here |
| How | `CLAUDE.md` + `tools/` | the verification lanes |

`tools/` are referenced submodules, each under its own license; we orchestrate
and wrap, never patch:

- `tools/host-lint` (Unlicense): hygiene / anti-slop; checks names against `host-grammar`.
- `tools/host-lifecycle` (Unlicense): token-free scaffolder/validator; generates names from `host-grammar`, so what it emits is exactly what `host-lint` accepts.
- `tools/allium` (MIT, JUXT): requirements + property-based testing.
- `tools/specula` (Apache-2.0): timing and concurrency via TLA+.

(`host-grammar`, the shared naming/numbering rules crate, is a build dependency of `host-lint` and `host-lifecycle`, not a host submodule.)

A lane is **mandatory once a spec of its kind exists** (RFC-2119 MUST; see `CLAUDE.md`): a `.allium` requires `tools/allium` + its skills + a `check`/`analyse`/`plan` CI lane with the obligations discharged by tests; a `.tla` requires `tools/specula` + a TLC lane. Adopting a lane is optional; ignoring a present spec's lane is a defect.

`.claude/skills/` are symlinks into those submodules' skills (reference, not
copy). They are **generated, not tracked**: `link-skills.sh` creates a link for each
*materialized* tool (skipping uninitialized submodules), because a tracked symlink
into an uninitialized tool dangles and trips any tree-walking tool.
Run it after `git submodule update --init`. Tool *outputs* are
project-owned. host-lifecycle ships one skill **per lifecycle phase** (classify,
adopt, embed, remap, verify, publish, upgrade, release), enumerated once in the
tool-readable `lifecycle.manifest`; unlike a lane, the lifecycle is driven by the
tool, and the rule is **every phase emits a receipt** (`done`/`skip`/`n-a` in
`.host-receipts`), not "every phase runs". A phase with no receipt is a
`software --check` HAZARD (`CLAUDE.md`).

The *Where* room is the software under test, **one or more** components, each
embedded as a **bare store with worktrees** under `software/<name>/`: the shared
object store is `software/<name>/.bare`, with a `.git` gitdir-link file beside
it, and each worktree is keyed by branch at
`software/<name>/<branch>/` (the branch keeps its slashes, so `feature/login`
nests). The canonical worktree (the audited state, where CI runs) is the
component's recorded `branch` (default `main`) checked out at the `pin`; the rest are
parallel lines, one per agent or live release branch. These trees are local and
gitignored (a single `/software/` entry); the host commits a recipe (`.host-software`)
with **one `[software "<name>"]` stanza per component** (mirroring `.gitmodules`),
each recording the source URL, the pinned canonical SHA, the canonical `branch`, and
any parallel-line branches, which `host-lifecycle software --materialize` realises
and `--check` audits. Operate on a single component, or one branch worktree of it,
with `--item <name>[@<branch>]`.
The recorded pin replaces a submodule gitlink as the
reproducibility anchor, so several branches stay materialized at once where a
single submodule tree could not. Software initiated under the methodology has
**reproducible builds**: the stanza also records the `build`/`toolchain` recipe and
the deployed `artifact` hash, so `host-lifecycle software --verify-build` can rebuild
from the pin and prove the deployed binary; migrated software not yet reproducible
carries a `repro-waiver = call/NNNN` case decision (see `CLAUDE.md`). A component that
ships static or self-contained binaries also records a `deps-bundle = <url> <sha256>`, a
pinned vendored-dependency bundle it downloads, verifies, and builds offline against under
`--network none`, so the build is hermetic (see `CLAUDE.md`). A component that
ships on several platforms records one `[build "<name>" "<platform>"]` subsection per
platform (each a distinct toolchain/artifact of the *same* pin, with an `attest-host`
naming the OS that reproduces it); the flat single-build form stays valid for the
single-platform case.

To instantiate: clone, `git submodule update --init` (the tools), run
`./link-skills.sh` (regenerate the skill symlinks for the tools you initialized),
replace the `cast/` examples with your own personas, and set up your software as a
bare store with worktrees (above). For bringing an *existing* repo under the
methodology instead, follow the `host` repo (`github.com/connollydavid/host`).

To publish docs with mdBook, run **`host-lifecycle book .`**, the canonical
publisher, so you do not hand-roll a generator that drops a room or re-derives the
src-scoping wrong. It writes a `book.toml` at the repo root scoped to a generated
`mdBook/src/` (never `src = "."`, which would walk the tool submodules and the
un-materialized software worktree and trip over whatever is not present), with the
built HTML in `mdBook/out/`, and a `SUMMARY.md` in
**lifecycle order**: Cast (Who), then Plan (When), then Software/Where (the What specs live
with the code, read as a stub from `.host-software`), then Call (Why), then
Reference/CLAUDE (How), then Memory. Then
`host-lifecycle book --check .` fails the build unless every room with source
renders a page, so a half-room site cannot ship. `book.toml` and the whole `mdBook/`
tree are generated output (gitignored), so a project keeps `docs/` for its own
authored documentation; the reference Site workflow under `.github/workflows/` runs
both before `mdbook build`, which still runs from the repo root.

A migrated or instantiated repo carries a `.host` stamp at its root
recording the template revision it adopted (`template`/`revision`/`adopted`),
written by `host-lifecycle adopt`. It is what a later upgrade diffs from. An
optional `name` line pins the published book's title, so `host-lifecycle book`
does not derive it from the checkout directory. An optional `book-mount` line
(default `/`) publishes the generated book under a sub-path of an existing site
instead of at its root: `host-lifecycle book` emits mdBook's `site-url` only for a
non-default mount, so a root-published `book.toml` stays byte-identical,
`book --print-mount` prints the normalized value, and the reference Site workflow
reads it from the tool to publish under the sub-path with the surrounding site kept.

The methodology lives in `CLAUDE.md`. Read it first. The whole template is
released into the public domain (Unlicense); see `README.md` for provenance.
